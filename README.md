MyConfigList
=========

There are some configuration files for me.
If you are interested in someone, well, keep it.
if you have more good ideas, please **tell me**,
I'll add them to my files. :P

The following is a list of configuration files:
*   [Zsh](./Zsh)          - The .zshrc file with some configs.
*   [Vim](./Vim)          - The .vimrc file with some plugins.
*   [Emacs](./Emacs)      - The .emacs file with .emacs.d folder.
*   [Tools](./tools)      - The tools list that useful for me.
*   [GoAgent](./proxy)    - The GoAgent configuration files.
*   [GFWList](./GFWList)  - The GFWList file and the SwitchySharp
                            Options backup.
*   [TPLink](./tp.bin)    - The router's options, it is my *private*
                            and you don't need it.

This list will update frequently.
